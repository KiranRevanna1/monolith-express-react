# Monolithic React + Express Boilerplate with TypeScript ❤

## Why i made this?
Short Answer: ***Personal Purpose***

Long Answer: Because me (or maybe you?) want to build a monorepo/monolith project with Express and React which combines server and frontend in one repository.
The reason why it's cost-effective are:
- That's right, because this boilerplate can be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for free.
- Because it can be easily integrate with Github.
- Because `Backend` and `Frontend` only have one `node_modules`.
- Because `Backend` and `Frontend` can share code with each other.
- The irony is, because you're `Backend` and `Frontend`.

## Setup
- Clone repository `$ git clone https://github.com/sutanlab/monolith-express-react.git`

- Install depedencies
```bash
# with npm
$ npm install

# or with yarn
$ yarn install
```

- Run server in development mode
```bash
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

- Build optimize production mode
```bash
$ npm run build
# or
$ yarn build
```

- Start server in production mode
```bash
$ npm start
# or
$ yarn start 
```
